# Building and sorting an array. Write the program we talked about at the
# beginning of this chapter, one that asks us to type as many words as we
# want (one word per line, continuing until we just press Enter on an
# empty line) and then repeats the words back to us in alphabetical order.
# Make sure to test your program thoroughly; for example, does hitting
# Enter on an empty line always exit your program? Even on the first line?
# And the second? Hint: Thereâ€™s a lovely array method that will give you a
# sorted version of an array: sort. Use it!

#puts 'enter some words'
#input = gets.chomp
#while gets != nil
array = ['test', 'apple', 'Joe', 'banana'].downcase
#break
#end
puts array.sort_by { |x| x.upcase}
